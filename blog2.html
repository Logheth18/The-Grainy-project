        <p class="content">Right now, thousands of people are registering a new domain name for a new idea or business.
            they are searching for the perfect font for their new website. <br>
            The best camera, lens, and tripod for their next photography trip. <br>
            The perfect filter for their next Instagram post. <br>
            It feels important. <br>None of it actually matters.<br>
            <b>The prolific creator doesn’t listen to any of this. They know the answer is simple. JUST START.
            When you start, there are some guarantees: </b> <br>
            <b>ONE :</b>Fear & anxiety of failure will never go away. Stop running. Live & thrive with them. They are the guiding light that shines upon what matters most. <br>
            <b>TWO: </b> Self-doubt will never cease and the work will never reach perfection. Aim for it anyway. <br>
            <b>THREE: </b>You will fail, hundreds if not thousands of times over your life. This is a benefit. You will learn what does not work. This is the only way to learn what does. <br>
            <b>FOUR:</b> You will never have the perfect tools or knowledge for the job. Start anyway and make the best of what you have. <br> 
            <b>Learn to watch these negative thoughts & emotions arrive and pass, again and again, day after day.</b><br>
            They never actually harm you, unless… you listen to them and treat them as reality. <br>

            When you listen to the negative thoughts they freeze you in place. <br>

            Powerless, you view your hopes and aspirations from across a chasm of fear & despair. <br>

            <b>This creates tension, anxiety, depression, and self-doubt.
                It will consume you & become the new normal.</b> <br>

            You must move! <br>

            Build the bridge. <br>

            Cross the chasm. <br>

            <b>Each step, as you cross, will feel like falling off a cliff.
                The bridge will build itself.</b> <br>

            You will not fall to your death. <br>

            With each step, some of the tension and anxiety will decrease and your trust in yourself will increase. <br>

            JUST START – STEP OFF THE CLIFF. <br>

            <b>The prolific creator starts now, no matter what. They don’t listen to all of the negative voices in their head or on the internet.
                They wake up every day & get to work on building the bridge across the chasm.</b> <br>

            Sometimes the work is great. <br>

            Most of the time it’s horrible. <br>

            None of this matters. <br>

            The work will improve. <br>

            But only through repetition & failure. <br>

            <b>All those bad feelings that come with bad work. They don’t matter either.
                Don’t listen to them.</b> <br>

            Wake up tomorrow and start again. <br>

            Then the next day, and the next year, and the next decade after that. <br>

            The daily short-term outcome does not matter. <br>

            You are working towards something you want to see exist in the world. <br>

            You are also learning to solve problems and pushing your boundaries each day. <br>

            This is one of the most valuable skills on the planet. <br>

            Hardly anyone is practicing it. <br>

            <b>Through thousands of repetitions and failures, day after day, the prolific creator slowly builds a valuable knowledge of their craft. They start to create world-class stuff.
                This knowledge is never found on YouTube videos or blogs, social media posts, or Instagram inspirational feeds.</b> <br>

            It can only be found by showing up day after day. <br>

            Failure after failure. <br>

            Battling your fears & getting one step closer to creating the ideas that you envision in your mind. <br>

            <b>Slowly, you’ll start to realize that none of the negative voices in your head had any idea what they were talking about.
                It was all spin.</b> <br>

            Mental propaganda & fear-based marketing. <br>

            Most of the world bought it. <br>

            The fear froze them in place. <br>

            They stayed safe. In line with the status quo. <br>

            Living daily with the anxiety, self-doubt, and quiet despair that comes from suppressing the great ideas that they have in their mind. <br>

            Which path will you take? <br>

            <b>The ancient filters of evolution and entropy need your ideas to fuel the battle of order vs. chaos, novel ideas vs. the cold steady state of mental death.
                The answer is simple.</b> <br>

            It always has been for billions of years. <br>

            The problem-solving knowledge is embedded in your genes and every cell in your body! <br>

            <b>You were made to:</b> <br>

            Create & test new ideas. <br>
            Solve problems, without answers. <br>
            Make things that don’t exist yet. <br>
            Throw yourself at the fear and chaos, coming out the other side smarter and stronger each time. <br>
