            There will never be a right time to start the big project that you have been talking about, yet putting off, for the past 5 years. <br>
            There will never be a perfect day to quit the soul-sucking job thatâ€™s wasting half of the few thousand days you are lucky enough to spend here on Earth. <br>
            You will never feel that your creative work is good enough to share with the world. <br>
            Those negative voices in your head, that tell you to stay put, safe, in line with the status quo, they will never go away.</p> <br>

            <p class="content">Right now, thousands of people are registering a new domain name for a new idea or business.
                they are searching for the perfect font for their new website. <br>
                    The best camera, lens, and tripod for their next photography trip. <br>
                    The perfect filter for their next Instagram post. <br>
            It feels important. <br>None of it actually matters.</p> <br>
